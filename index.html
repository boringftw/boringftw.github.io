<br />
You've come to the right website. Just keep reading. I am posting content here that will help you learn about Generative AI, building agentic systems and software engineering in general.
<br />
<br />
But before you proceed, you need to remember..
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Machines don't learning and software don't think!</span>

Crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas
<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Understanding the problem statement</li>
  <li>Creating agent personas with clear objectives</li>
  <li>Writing clear yet clever prompts</li>
  <li>Developing simple and effective software</li>
  <li>Owning what you build (You build it, you run it)</li>
</ul>
<br />
