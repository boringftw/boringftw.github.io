Will machines take over the world? Will robots become more intelligent than humans? Are unicorns real? Or is this all just another bubble?

As simply this can be stated - Machines don't learn. 

Don't get fooled by marketing.

The purpose of machine learning is to build statistical computers that can create an approximation function and figures out how to map a domain of x to its range of y. It's all math.

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Besides, any machine learning use case that has seen the light of production, is 10-20% ML and 80-90% elegant software engineering: APIs, security, rate limiting, data engineering, caching, monitoring, etc.
