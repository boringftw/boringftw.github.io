Hi there!

I am Saurav, a software engineer, interested in software engineering, AI and a few other things.
I started this site to write about my thoughts, mostly on tech, things that I've been able to learn (I hope) working over a decade in this field, that may help others as well.

Happy to learn, happy to share.
