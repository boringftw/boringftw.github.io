Hi there! I am Saurav.

I am a product-led solution architect and software engineer, been an enterprise Java and Python developer, and Azure specialist. I'm now into Generative AI, identifying adding agentic capabilities to enterprise software (where they fit), driving use case development and discovering what works and what doesn't.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sauravdey/).
