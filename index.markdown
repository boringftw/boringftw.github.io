<span class="important">Building agentic software?</span>
<br />
<br />

Keep reading...
I am posting content here that will help you learn about Generative AI, agentic AI and software engineering in general.
But before you proceed, you need to remember..
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Machines don't learn or think like humans do! It's all math.</span><a href="/2025/04/02/is-ml-really-making-machines-intelligent/">Know more...</a>
<br />
<br />

In my opinion, crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas...
<br />
<br />
✅ Understanding the problem statement<br />
✅ Creating agent personas with clear objectives<br />
✅ <a href="/2025/04/26/llms-and-bayes-theorem/">Writing clever prompts</a><br />
✅ Developing simple and effective workflows<br />
✅ Retrospect, and own what you build (You build it, you run it)
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">To build your (or your team's) capabilities in Generative and agentic AI what do you need to do?</span>
<br />
<br />

✅ Stop thinking that AI is the answer to all your problems<br />
✅ Be part of, or develop an excellent engineering culture<br />
✅ Collaborate, experiment and learn; understand what others are doing<br />
✅ Move from jargon-driven development to value-driven development<br />
✅ Learn Python, async programming, API development and one database<br />
<br />
Then, 
<br />
<br />
✅ Start small; build a simple chat bot and experiment with prompts<br />
✅ Before jumping into agents, start with a simple RAG workflow<br />
✅ Learn vector databases, text embedding, chunking and tool usage<br />
✅ Learn different RAG techniqies<br />
✅ Understand the economics of cloud computing<br />
<br />
Then, 
<br />
<br />
✅ Build a system with two agents that interact with each other<br />
✅ Learn structured output and guardrails<br />
✅ Learn agentic workflow patterns, orchestration<br />
✅ Add more agents, experiment and learn<br />
✅ Finally, logging, monitoring, LLMOps and deployment<br />
